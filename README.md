Project: Automating a Multi-Tier Application on VMware with Ansible
Objective:
Use Ansible to fully automate the deployment, configuration, and orchestration of a multi-tier application (e.g., LAMP stack) across multiple CentOS VMs (master node, node1, and node2) in a VMware environment.

Steps:
Provisioning VMs:

Use Ansible to deploy and configure two nodes (node1 and node2) on VMware.
Automate the installation of necessary dependencies like Apache on one node and MySQL on the other.
Role-based Deployment:

Use Ansible roles to separate the tasks:
Web server role (for node1 to host Apache/PHP).
Database server role (for node2 to host MySQL/MariaDB).
Deploy a simple PHP application on the web server node and configure it to communicate with the database on node2.
Network Configuration & Load Balancing:

Automate firewall rules, IP tables, and networking configurations between the nodes.
Optionally, use HAProxy or Nginx as a load balancer.
Centralized Monitoring and Logging:

Set up a monitoring tool like Prometheus or Nagios on the master node to monitor the nodes (node1 and node2).
Collect logs from both the web and database servers and centralize them using tools like Logstash.
Backup and Recovery Automation:

Automate backups of the database on node2 using Ansible scheduled jobs.
Automate web content backup on node1.
Security:

Implement Ansible Vault to manage secrets such as database credentials.
Use Ansible to apply security updates and harden the systems.
Outcome:
A fully automated infrastructure with multiple VMs on VMware, deploying a multi-tier application.
Centralized monitoring and logging for system health and performance.
Secure and efficient infrastructure with automated backups and firewall configurations.
This project gives hands-on experience with configuration management, automation, and managing complex multi-tier applications with Ansible.
